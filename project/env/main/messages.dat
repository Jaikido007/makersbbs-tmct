Hello, world
Is anyone out there?
Advert for a FRIDGE for sale.
I'm lonely.
Horseriding lessons.
Jim's great. I just want to say that.
How's the weather?
I can't post photos so here's a description of my cat.
My nice poems.
Hello!
I've been poisoned by my constituents.
Small change got rained on with his own 48.
I got diamonds on my windshield.
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes.
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly.
Isn't that she, coming to me?
Nearly.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Do you hear that noise too? 
What's up, doc?
Another message.
